# DeepPicar

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/mbechtel2/DeepPicar-v2/blob/master/images/DeepPicar.jpg" width="360" height="360"/></p>

DeepPicar is a low-cost autonomous RC car platform using a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN). DeepPicar is a small scale replication
of NVIDIA's real self-driving car called Dave-2, which drove on public
roads using a CNN. DeepPicar uses the same CNN architecture of NVIDIA's
Dave-2 and can drive itself in real-time locally on a Raspberry Pi 3.
